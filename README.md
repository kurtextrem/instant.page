ℹ️ Info is on [the website](https://instant.page).

Changes of this fork:

 🚀  &nbsp; Added `prerender` for Blink based browsers, which improves performance even more than `prefetch`
 
 ✨  &nbsp; Support for Safari, where only `preload` is supported [at the moment](https://caniuse.com/link-rel-prefetch)

 🧪  &nbsp; For Chrome on Android: this fork implements the [PrerenderV2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P2VKCLpmnNm_cRAjUeE-bqLL0bslL_zKqiNeCzNom_w/edit) `speculationrules` script tag.
 
 The new flow is as follows:
 
 - On desktop, hover: `prefetch` (`preload` in Safari) after `HOVER_DELAY` ms (**65 ms** by default, can be set by adding `data-instant-intensity` to the body)
 - On desktop, click: `prerender`
 - On mobile, hover & click: `prerender` + `speculationrules` (since hover is most likely a click on mobile)
 - On mobile, if network is slower than 4G (LTE) or `Save-Data` is enabled, we cancel previous fetches when a new link is hovered
